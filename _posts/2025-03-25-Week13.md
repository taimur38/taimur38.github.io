# Weekly Note

This is my first weekly note. I have wanted to move on from my daily note scratchpads to a weekly note scratchpad because things tend to carry on over time, and I was using daily notes this way anyway. The other reason was that on this walk, I realized I've been reading and annotating and highlighting lots of things and I should collect it and try to share it more publicly on substack or something. So, all the things I'm sharing, I'm going to try and also keep track of here in my weekly note. It may get unwieldy but thats fine.. If it does, then I can make a weekly folder, which has a 'sharings' file and a 'scratchpad' file under it. But I doubt it. They can just go under separate headings. 

Let's start with the last few things I shared.

# American Decline 

"How did you go bankrupt?" "Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly" - Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises

Models of systems that evolve over time are often defined in terms of state variables and jump variables. State variables tend to change smoothly - their value in the next period is a function of their value today, implying some stickiness in their movement over time. For example, savings in period 2 is equal to savings in period 1 times the interest rate. Jump variables, as indicated by their name, are not constrained by this. It’s true that the norms underpinning the American political system have been eroding under Trump, and their continued erosion will likely lead to the gradual decline of the country. But if we want to look for potential sources of a violent crash, we should look at jump variables. This leads us to the financial system. The United States is very levered, and has enjoyed a privileged position at the heart of international capital flows for a long time. If something were to threaten that privileged position, it could result in instantaneous movements in capital that result in a hard crash for the country. Carmen Reinhart writes about different types of financial crises:

- **Sudden Stop Crises**: These occur when capital inflows to a country abruptly cease or reverse. Foreign investors suddenly withdraw their money, leading to currency depreciation, sharp economic contraction, and often a banking crisis.
- **Banking Crises**: Widespread bank failures or significant bank distress where financial institutions face liquidity problems and potential insolvency.
- **Sovereign Debt Crises**: When governments default on their debt obligations or require rescue packages from international institutions.
- **Currency Crises**: Sharp depreciation of a country's currency, often accompanied by capital flight.
- **Twin Crises**: These involve the simultaneous occurrence of banking and currency crises, which tend to be particularly severe.
- **Triple Crises**: When banking, currency, and sovereign debt crises occur simultaneously.
- **Inflation Crises**: Periods of exceptionally high inflation that destabilize economies.

Some OpEds in the FT recently have been discussing potential triggers for these kinds of crises in the US. Barry Eichengreen asked [Can the dollar remain king of currencies?]( https://on.ft.com/4kM0cAz) in a weekend essay - one paragraph which stood out to me involved outright appropriation of foreign investors:

> There are questions, moreover, about whether foreign holders of US debt securities will continue to be treated fairly. Scott Bessent, Trump’s Treasury secretary, has reportedly mulled the possibility of converting five- and 10-year US treasury bonds held by foreign investors into 100-year securities bearing low interest rates, whether those investors like it or not. During the 2024 presidential campaign, advisers to Trump such as Robert Lighthizer mooted the possibility of taxing foreign purchases of US treasuries as a way of driving down the dollar and enhancing the competitiveness of US exports.

It's worth remembering that these things don't need to actually happen to spark the crises - if expectations change, it is enough. Ruchir Sharma argues that capital is already moving away from the US in a long-overdue correction in [The end of American exceptionalism goes way beyond Trump](https://on.ft.com/4bXZcp9)

> So far, the move out of US equities has been led by the fast-money crowd, including hedge funds. Many others have yet to follow. Even as consumer and small business surveys show declining confidence, American retail investors keep buying the dip. They have poured more money into US stocks every day (but one) since prices peaked late last month. Often, they are using the most aggressive vehicles available, such as leveraged ETFs.
> 
> Foreign investors, from Australian pension funds to Japanese insurance companies, keep moving money into the US, too. In recent years, more than 80 per cent of the money invested in stock market funds worldwide went to the US. Having more than tripled their American equity holdings to $20tn over the past decade, foreigners now own 30 per cent of the US stock market, a record high.

It would be interesting to read an analysis of what the impact of a sudden stop would be to the overall economy, both domestically and internationally. And it would be interesting to see how sensitive the economy would be to a global decline in demand for us assets - what is the elasticity?
