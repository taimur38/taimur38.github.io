Adam Toozes [Chartbook](https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-369-is-it-madness-or-is) on the Trump Tariffs

> In these head-scratching days it is useful to try to locate the madness of Trumpian economic policy in more familiar policy space. The aim is not to make strong analogies but to ease the pain of thinking about all the nonsense by offering other cases that we have already thought through.

> Brexit comes to mind because it is another case of gratuitous of economic self-harm dressed up in the language of economic sovereigntism, manliness etc.

> What trade models do highlight is the long-run damage done by the inefficiency of disassembling and then reassembling (if you are lucky) the global division of labour. In a huge, rich economy like the US, those inefficiencies will be knife cuts rather than hammer blows. But they will hurt low-income households. And if the Brexit example is anything to go by they will hurt [smaller businesses](https://www.ft.com/content/6d086552-7290-4e7a-978a-bb0f0c9119c5), less able to set prices and less able to cope with the shock.

> Over the longer run, can tariffs support industrial growth? Sure. But generally that is a recipe for catch-up growth on the part of poor countries. Can rich countries use trade policy to sustain industry? Of course they can. Think of Switzerland and its efforts to hold down the value of its currency to maintain a balanced economic structure. Or think of the tacit protectionism exercised through public procurement from national military-industrial champions.

> If we take the current obsession with manufacturing seriously, if we credit that Trump and Biden and so many of the folks caught uncomfortably in the space between them truly want to see America reindustrialize, then what do they need? Investment! Investment, investment, investment.

> And what have we learned from all those years debating green industrial policy discussion, Bidenomics, the energy transition, the Green New Deal etc? Price signals are not enough.

> But investors are certainly going to need to know that these tariffs are permanent, which is one thing that the Trump crew seem not to agree on.


[Paul Krugman on Trade Deficits and Manufacturing](https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/a-note-on-trade-deficits-and-manufacturing)

> International comparisons: In terms of trade, Germany is the anti-America. As we have moved into trade deficit, Germany has moved into massive trade surplus. In fact, Germany’s surpluses are much larger as a share of its own GDP than China’s. Yet Germany has also seen a huge long-term decline in the manufacturing share of employment
> ...
> The fact is that the world needs fewer manufacturing workers than it used to, just as it no longer needs a lot of farmers, and even countries that run big surpluses in manufacturing trade can’t buck that trend. This doesn’t mean that we should abandon efforts to promote manufacturing where that makes sense. But we should do so with a realistic appreciation of the fact that we are going to be mainly a service economy no matter what, and that if we really want to help workers we have to make all jobs better, not dream of a return to an old-time economy.

[Paul Krugman on Deficits and the Dollar](https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-dollar-and-the-trade-deficit)

> What caused the sudden Reagan-era surge in trade deficits? As macroeconomic stories go, this one is especially clear. (I used to love covering it when I taught undergraduate macro.) By cutting taxes while increasing military spending, Reagan pushed the U.S. budget into deficit. This deficit spending would, other things equal, have been inflationary; but the Federal Reserve contained this inflationary pressure by keeping interest rates high. High interest rates, in turn, attracted inflows of foreign capital, pushing up the value of the dollar.

> You can see that soaring dollar in the chart at the top of this post. And the strong dollar made U.S. production uncompetitive, leading to large trade deficits. In fact, for a while the dollar was almost ridiculously strong relative to other advanced-country currencies; in 1985 [Harrods](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/18/business/weak-pound-an-opportunity.html), the London department store,

> > advertised its January sales in the United States, suggesting that Americans slip over to London to stock up on cheap Scottish woolens, cashmere coats and so on. A lot of them did.

> But the dollar slid soon afterwards; to this day it remains unclear how much if any of that slide was caused by the [Plaza Accord](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plaza-accord.asp), an agreement by the major economies to try to push the dollar down. In any case both the dollar and the trade deficit declined a lot by 1990.

> Then both soared again during the Clinton years. But the story was quite different. Budget deficits were falling, not rising; the driver of Clinton-era trade deficits was a huge boom in private investment, much of it tied to information technology (although during the Bush years the focus turned to real estate.)

> Why am I going over this old history? Because there are pretty good reasons to believe that we’re about to see a recapitulation of the Reagan-era rise in the trade deficit.

> Trump, after all, clearly wants to make his 2017 tax cuts, much of which were set to expire, permanent; he also threw out a lot of promises of other tax cuts during the campaign, and might try to honor at least some of them.


Jesus shared a very cool paper from the Barcelona School of Economics on [Climate change on Labor and Capital Reallocation](https://focus.bse.eu/the-effects-of-climate-change-on-labor-and-capital-reallocation). These were the main takeaways

1. Regions with higher excess dryness experience a large reduction in agricultural production. A municipality moving from the median to the 90th percentile of excess dryness experiences an 8% decline in both area farmed and value of agricultural production. If it moves from median to 90th percentile of excess dryness relative to its historical average experiences declines in area farmed of about 15% and total value of ag production of more than 20% in the last two decades. 
2. In the short run, local economies insure themselves against negative weather shocks via financial integration with other regions. Credit flows into regions of drought..
3. Over the long run, persistent dryness generates a sharp reduction in credit to all sectors. ... In addition, they find that this contraction in credit leads to a large reduction in manufacturing employment. Thus, capital market frictions appear to be a key constraint for optimal factor adjustment in response to climate change.


[What is behind the Treasury sell-off?](https://on.ft.com/3EieoRn)

> In recent years, such trades have exploded — albeit on a scale that is hard to track. Indeed, the explosion is so marked that three of the top five sources for non-US Treasury demand have been Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands and London — hedge fund centres.
> 
> The IMF recently (gu)estimated that these trades are worth $1tn, while Bloomberg analysis suggests that hedge funds hold 7 per cent of all Treasuries, seemingly more than dealer banks, and a sharp increase. Slok, for his part, says they total “$800bn and [are] an important part of the $2tn outstanding in prime brokerage balances.”
> 
> Either way, as bond markets tumble it seems likely that some funds are being forced to unwind trades, creating a whiplash effect similar to the one seen in 2020. And what makes this worse is that as market luminaries such as Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio issue dire warnings about America’s surging debt, chatter about putative future default risks is rising too.
> 
> The White House insists this is ridiculous. But traders know that when Trump was “just” a businessman, he repeatedly defaulted on his own debt. Some of the wilder policy ideas now floating around the White House include putative debt swaps, or quasi restructuring. Once-unimaginable scenarios are being imagined — and priced in.
> 
> Then there is the elephant in the bond room: the risk that the US-China trade war turns into a capital war, prompting Beijing (currently the second-biggest holder of Treasuries) to run from dollar assets.
> 
> There is scant proof of this happening — yet. But Beijing made one striking money move this week: it has let the renminbi weaken against the dollar, raising the prospect of currency wars. That makes it easier to imagine other scenarios. “Beware a trade war shift to a financial war,” wrote the head of FX research at Deutsche Bank.

[Martin Short on Liberation Day](https://www.ft.com/content/d96d4a44-2b75-4222-b77a-afe72c1b9174)
> His administration is engaged in a comprehensive assault on the American republic and the global order it created. Under attack domestically are the state, the rule of law, the role of the legislature, the role of the courts, the commitment to science and the independence of the universities. All these were the pillars on which US freedom and prosperity rested. Now, he is destroying the liberal international order. Soon, I presume, Trump will be invading countries, as he proceeds to restore the age of empires.


[Dani Rodrik Trilemma](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2019/06/rodrik-trilemma-trade-globalization)

> His thesis, which became one of his first published papers, explained why the political mobilization of two peasant populations in the 1950s, in Turkey and in Egypt, resulted in two very different outcomes: entrenched conservatism in Turkey, and a radical revolution in Egypt. His answer hinged on the different ways that agriculture had been commercialized. In Egypt, the commodification of land resulted in a proliferation of absentee landlords and widespread landlessness among peasants—conditions that impelled them to align against the landowners. In Turkey, this process was not nearly as intense, and peasants maintained ties to, and derived a measure of security from, their landlords. That argument reflects important tendencies that continue to distinguish Rodrik’s thought. In any problem in political economy, he foregrounds local and institutional context. He is suspicious of arguments that explain a nation’s political or economic fortune in terms of “culture,” recognizing the susceptibility of this idea to fallacy, clichés, or just-so stories.

> His resulting book, _Has Globalization Gone Too Far?_ (1997), is a short monograph that remains Rodrik’s most cited work to date. It develops three interconnected ideas about the tension between globalization and the stability and sovereignty of nations. Trade undermines the bargaining power of workers, who can more easily be substituted for one another across national borders. It also creates conflicts between, and within, nations over their most fundamental values—like labor laws and environmental regulations—when negotiating trade agreements. Prevailing international treaties on trade, Rodrik writes, ignore this problem. Finally, although trade makes the public more vulnerable and reliant on social welfare, it also undermines governments’ ability to provide that welfare, by setting the wealthy footloose to shield their money from taxation around the world.

> Rodrik argued that the rewards of globalization can be realized only if it is not taken to an extreme. What he calls “maximum globalization” or “hyperglobalization” can work only if _all_ countries adopt the same set of rules that are overseen by an accountable global government. But this degree of integration is impossible and undesirable, he maintains: nations have different preferences about the types of institutions and regulations they want, as his life’s work has shown. And they should be entitled to those preferences, he insists—in order to make democratically accountable decisions within their borders.
> 
> Hence his “trilemma”:
>
> • A nation can be democratic and sovereign, but then it cannot be hyperglobalized.
>
> • It can be hyperglobalized and democratic, but then it would have to give up its national sovereignty to a global government.
>
> • Or it can be sovereign and hyperglobalized, but it would have to abandon democratic accountability.

> His preference is to abandon hyperglobalization. “I do think there is something special about the nation-state,” he says. “It creates reciprocal obligations that don’t exist across national borders.”

Michael Pettis on the Dollar and [Exorbitant Burden](https://www.ft.com/content/a3fb6b82-4a51-4a5c-b831-f755518f5863)

> For instance, when a country suppresses domestic demand in order to subsidise its own manufacturing, in an open global trading environment the resulting trade surpluses might normally be reversed by market forces. But by restricting its trade and capital accounts and intervening in its currency, that country can prevent such an adjustment. In this case its manufacturing trade surplus must be absorbed by those of its partners who exert much less control over their trade and capital accounts. What is more, as its share of global manufacturing rises relative to its share of global demand, that of its more open trade partners must decline.
That’s why it is not just coincidence that the US, with its deep, flexible and well-governed financial markets has manufacturing shares of GDP well below the global average, unlike economies such as China’s with persistent surpluses, who have manufacturing shares well above the global average. Industrial policies aimed at restructuring more highly controlled domestic economies also in effect restructure the economies of their more open trade partners.
> ...
> However if the world is unable to come to such an agreement, the US is justified in acting unilaterally to reverse its role in accommodating policy distortions abroad, as it is doing now. The most effective way is likely to be by imposing controls on the US capital account that limit the ability of surplus countries to balance their surpluses by acquiring US assets. While this may at first seem to go against current US policy under Trump, who wants to increase foreign direct investment, if done correctly capital controls would in fact have little effect on direct investment. A less effective way is through controls on the US trade account, with bilateral tariffs an especially clumsy way of addressing the root causes of trade imbalances.

There was a cool paper which was summarized in this table ![table](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoNMoV2bEAAL_Yb?format=png) (credit to the original [tweet](https://x.com/SteveStuWill/status/1910454933029347488/photo/1)). 

I think a very cool exercise to take the list of cognitive biases and try to map them to a few fundamental beliefs that drive them. The nice outcome of this exercise seems to be a relatively small number of fundamental beliefs that can be mapped to these biases. Good to revist these types of fundamental beliefs, or at least identify when they are operating - maybe it will help us take a step back in our thought process. 

Paul Krugman on [The Third Worlding of America](https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-third-worlding-of-america)

> There’s an old line about military analysis: “Amateurs talk about tactics, but professionals talk about logistics.” Well, when it comes to taking the pulse of financial markets, amateurs talk about stocks, but professionals talk about bond and currency markets. That’s because bond and currency markets are generally less driven by emotion. There’s no “meme gambling investing” in bond and currency markets. And these markets are both signaling major loss of faith in America.

> The key point is that massive tariffs have disrupted the plumbing of the financial system, leading to soaring interest rates on U.S. government debt. That’s abnormal: rising odds of a recession usually lead to falling long-term interest rates, because the prospect of a recession raises the likelihood of future cuts by the Fed, which controls short-term rates. This time, however, rates are spiking, especially for very-long-term instruments like 30-year bonds, shown at the top of this post.

> The common thread in currency and bond markets is that, thanks to Trump, dollar assets — traditionally the foundation of the global financial system — are no longer perceived as safe.

> The combination of interest rates soaring amid a slump and the currency plunging despite rising interest rates isn’t what we normally expect for advanced countries, let alone the owner of the world’s leading reserve currency. It is, however, what we often see in emerging-market economies. That is, investors have started treating the United States like a third-world economy.
