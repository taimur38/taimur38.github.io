# Stuff I Came Across 

[The people vs Elon Musk: billionaire transforms Wisconsin court contest](https://www.ft.com/content/8ace0235-151c-4aa8-8b46-5e57bdb19b0c?shareType=nongift)

> In recent days, Musk has revived a potentially illegal tactic first deployed in swing states during the presidential election last year, offering potential voters $100 each to sign a petition opposing “activist judges” and awarding $1mn to one of the signatories, Scott Ainsworth from Green Bay. Musk handed out two more such awards in person on Sunday, after the Wisconsin courts declined to stop him from doing so.

> In January, Tesla filed a lawsuit against the state in a court in the county over Wisconsin’s refusal to let the carmaker bypass rules for local dealerships. Just days later, Musk’s political vehicles began donating to Wisconsin Republicans, records show.


[America cannot afford to break global investor trust](https://on.ft.com/4hW1d6r)

> International holdings of US Treasury securities stand at $8.5tn, a quarter of the total. Debt portfolio flows fund 90 per cent of the US current account deficit. Both public and total US liabilities are heavily reliant on overseas appetite for US debt securities. 
> ...
> However, recent rhetoric underlies an excessive optimism on US leverage — the world needs America, but not the opposite.
> 
> This view is only right insofar as global investors are willing to fund US growing imbalances.

I re-read this note from Fukuyama on the election because there was a discussion on why there was no real resistance to Trump in power. 

[Francis Fukuyama: what Trump unleashed means for America](https://on.ft.com/40E8Olk)

> Prior to the election, critics including Kamala Harris accused Trump of being a fascist. This was misguided insofar as he was not about to implement a totalitarian regime in the US. Rather, there would be a gradual decay of liberal institutions, much as occurred in Hungary after Viktor Orbán’s return to power in 2010.

> This decay has already started, and Trump has done substantial damage. He has deepened an already substantial polarisation within society, and turned the US from a high-trust to a low-trust society; he has demonised the government and weakened belief that it represents the collective interests of Americans; he has coarsened political rhetoric and given permission for overt expressions of bigotry and misogyny; and he has convinced a majority of Republicans that his predecessor was an illegitimate president who stole the 2020 election.


I mostly enjoyed the garden metaphor in this [substack article](https://post.substack.com/p/from-the-temple-to-the-garden)

> A distributed system that gives economic autonomy to independent voices resembles a garden more than a temple. Handled with the right care, it can bring order to social media’s bedlam.

> In a media garden, where biodiversity flourishes, there can be more winners and better coverage of a vast multitude of niches. In such a system, everyone has a role in shaping the culture they live in. Creators can thrive on the support of their followers, who can simultaneously help the work spread.

> While some worry that such a system will lead to more echo chambers, we believe the opposite could also be true. By networking diverse communities together, this garden-like system makes it easy to move freely and be exposed to new ways of thinking in a more moderate environment, removed from the quick-twitch subcultures of chaos media.

> Unlike chaos media, this distributed system can be rooted in trust, since the rewards flow to those who respect relationships rather than gaming algorithms. This relationship-centric model is apparent in YouTube, where people show up for their favorite shows and creators (_Don’t forget to like and subscribe_). But even there, the relationships are mediated and controlled by advertisers and the platform itself. Direct subscriptions foster a deeper connection and stronger sense of trust. For publishers to thrive in this incentive structure, they must deeply serve their audiences.

> This system gives rise to new media personalities such as [Caroline Chambers](https://open.substack.com/users/17556349-caroline-chambers?utm_source=mentions), who turned a spurned book proposal into a thriving community, [What To Cook When You Don’t Feel Like Cooking](https://whattocook.substack.com/), which in turn scored her a deal for a new book that became a New York Times bestseller. And it gives more power to independent interviewers such as [Dwarkesh Patel](https://open.substack.com/users/4281466-dwarkesh-patel?utm_source=mentions), who hosts deep discussions with prominent thinkers in science, tech, and culture, fueled by a mix of direct payments and ads. New gatekeepers will emerge under this model, but unlike in the old systems, audiences will choose for themselves which communities improve their online lives. It’s a more organic ecosystem, where trust forms the root system connecting diverse communities, allowing us to think together rather than shout each other down.

> The chaos of our current media moment cannot last, but no one knows exactly what the new landscape will look like when it stabilizes. That’s precisely why your choices today matter so much. Every subscription, every share, every minute of your attention is a vote for the culture you want to see flourish. You can choose to invest in a system that values deep relationships over the flimsy validation that chaos media offers. You can reclaim your attention from the doomscroll feeds and pour it like water onto the seedlings of a better future. These actions aren’t just about getting better content or contributing to a healthier media economy—they cultivate a richer, more thoughtful culture capable of addressing the complex challenges of our time. It’s a culture worth subscribing to.

>Third, they recognise that what is happening to the US has clear upsides for their own country. It has dawned on just about everybody by now that Trump’s signature is worthless. A man who is trying to demolish the Canadian economy is not going to be a reliable friend to anybody else. So, the alliances the US will need to balance China in its own neighbourhood or, for that matter, anywhere else are likely to be very fragile. This applies even to Japan and South Korea, let alone other neighbours. In this environment, China, the Asia-Pacific’s principal trading power, as well as a rapidly rising military power, is bound to dominate not just the region, but well beyond that. Even Europe, concerned about Russia and so openly abandoned by the US, will seek a friendlier relationship with China. Trump’s “America First” is bound to mean America alone.

> Many think that China’s demographic challenges are bound to destroy the economy. But the problem right now is too few good jobs, not too few workers. It is a demand problem, not one of potential supply. That will remain the case for a long time, because of surplus rural workers.

> Nowadays, Chinese policymakers refer to “investment in consumption”. It is an interesting concept. Yet the chief requirements are to lower the savings rate by shifting income towards households, developing the social safety net and increasing public consumption.

Then came liberation day. These next articles and clippings are related to making some sense of the moment. 

Donald Trump baffles economists with tariff formula [https://on.ft.com/4cdVSGh](https://on.ft.com/4cdVSGh)

> Thomas Sampson, associate professor of economics at the London School of Economics, said the formula was “a figleaf for Trump’s misguided obsession with bilateral trade imbalances” and that there was “no economic rationale” for the tariffs.

> More broadly, Sampson said tariffs would not remove the underlying macroeconomic driver of the US trade deficit. “As long as the US does not save enough to finance its own investment, it has to borrow from the rest of the world. And that requires it to run a trade deficit. Tariffs don’t change that logic.”

[Michael Pettis on Trump Tariffs](https://x.com/michaelxpettis/status/1907629516043784509)

[A review on Trade Wars are Class Wars](https://www.phenomenalworld.org/reviews/trade-wars/)

> More forcefully, Pettis and Klein also demonstrate that current account imbalances can equally be driven by changes in the capital account, to which changes in the current account balance are mere residuals. This is a rebuttal to the proposed trade policies of both America First reactionaries like Josh Hawley and friendly social democrats like Bernie Sanders, who regret the loss of the industrial Midwest. In the case of the US, the status of the dollar as global reserve currency mechanically forces sizable current account deficits, regardless of any domestic desire to import. Financial outflows mean that some marginal good—blenders, spark plugs, pork bellies, whatever—will be cheap enough to be imported rather than produced, owing to exchange rate movements. This doesn’t say anything about the conditions in the market for those goods in the trading countries, just that the world is demanding more US dollars than it currently has. Were the US to throw up trade barriers in response to the global demand for its financial assets, it would only worsen its own terms of trade—get fewer blenders, spark plugs, or pork bellies in exchange—as the capital account imbalance was driven by external demand for dollars, not domestic demand for products. Pettis and Klein demonstrate that pressure can come from either side of the “current account balance = negative capital account balance” equation. This is something which escapes many economists and policymakers on the left and right alike, who believe that the federal deficit is a problem that can be solved by closing the trade deficit, and that the trade deficit can be closed by tariffs alone. The US is no longer a developing country protecting infant industries. Pretending that it is will not bring the kinds of employment gains people claim to expect. To cut down on the US current account deficit, Pettis and Klein argue, capital controls are necessary.

> But while German officials complained about wasteful spending by southern European countries, German elites saved a large and growing proportion of national output. To preserve their export advantage, this savings could not go to households. Instead, German savers invested abroad. The irony is that German investors made a substantial _net loss_ on these foreign holdings, all while the German government allowed domestic infrastructure to crumble. (And given recent [revelations](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062878816/dark-towers/), it’s no stretch to think some of these German investments were even locked up in the Trump organization!) The German government was right to think that their moral hazard arguments would forestall both international debt relief and domestic investment. Problem was, this ultimately prevented government spending on positive ROI projects in Germany and southern European countries, while subsidizing negative ROI investments abroad by the German financial sector.

And a thought I had while walking through the Chicago institute of art, while I was looking at fragments of statues from roman times which had been preserved. "Imagine if all that lasts of your work is a fragment, a single paragraph written in a report otherwise torn and scorched by flame. Would it end up in a museum? Would people thousands of years from now look on in awe and wonder about the rest of it." I would like to strive for more Quality in my work. This low-key blog is very much not that - more inspired by Adam Tooze's "Chartbook". But otherwise, I would like to keep that as a constant reminder to do better.
